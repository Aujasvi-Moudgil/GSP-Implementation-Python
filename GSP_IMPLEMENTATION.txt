CASE STUDY- GSP IMPLEMENTATION

1. The folder ‘Data_GSP’ consists of data files from “all-backup recommendation” provided. 
2. The code is implemented in python 2.7 (spyder).
3. If we run main.py, we get patterns by n-candidate level GSP but it doesn’t count tuples. 
   Like in multiple user data for each timestamp, there can be more than 1 items.
4. If we run main2.py, we get patterns by 2-candidate level GSP where tuples can be observed in (    ,   ).
5. Threshold (min. support)  and Level are variable, can be changed to see different patterns by GSP.
6. gsp and gsp2 classes files.
7. Some of the result screenshots produced by GSP is provided in the slides with different threshold (support) and levels.
